# OSS Investment Scorecard
### 开源项目投资评估框架 · AI周期专版

> **A structured, weighted scoring framework for USD-denominated VC funds evaluating open source projects during the AI technology acceleration cycle.**

Built from practice, not theory — calibrated against real deals including vLLM/Inferact ($150M @ $800M) and Hugging Face ($235M @ $4.5B).

She has 15+ years in product commercialization and capital strategy, with two prior startup exits. This framework was developed from direct evaluation work — not synthesized from secondary sources.

## 📢 V1.2 Update: From "Scoring Rubric" to "Diligence Protocol"

**March 2026 Update:** We have officially released **V1.2** of the framework. This update is a structural leap designed to eliminate bias when evaluating early-stage projects (Seed/Series A) where public data is often scarce.

**Key Improvements in V1.2:**
- **Mandatory Fact Sheet:** A 7-item pre-evaluation gate including competitive benchmarking.
- **Indirect Signal Inference:** Guidelines for using SOC2, billing complexity, and hiring signals to estimate traction when ARR is not public.
- **Project Age Calibration:** Prioritizing **Velocity** over absolute levels for projects <12 months old.
- **Narrative Pivot Exemptions:** Distinguishing market-following pivots from failure-driven ones.

## 📖 Framework Overview

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **A. Open-Source Ecosystem Health** | 25% | Keyboard metrics: active contributors, PR velocity, production dependents, governance tier |
| **B. Team & Globalisation** | 20% | Engineering depth × GTM capability; US market access |
| **C. Technical Moat & Positioning** | 20% | L1-L4 technology ladder; narrative consistency; de facto standard potential |
| **D. Commercialisation & PMF** | 20% | Revenue quality hierarchy; PS vs ARR distinction; customer concentration |
| **E. Capital Exit Path** | 15% | M&A urgency; IPO readiness; comparable exits |

**Score Thresholds:**
- 🟢 **8.5–10.0** → Strongly Recommend
- 🟡 **7.0–8.4** → Recommend with Conditions
- 🟠 **5.5–6.9** → Watch / Track (re-evaluate in 6-9 months)
- 🔴 **< 5.5** → Pass

**One-Vote Vetoes:** 6 conditions that trigger automatic Pass regardless of total score. See [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for full details.

## 🛡️ Optional Module: Star Health & Anti-Fraud Protocol

In the AI-cycle, GitHub stars have become a highly manipulable vanity metric. To ensure the integrity of **Dimension A (Ecosystem Health)**, analysts may optionally trigger the **Star Health Protocol** to detect "surface-level" popularity vs. real developer utility.

### When to use:
- Projects in hyper-hyped sectors (e.g., AI Agents, RAG wrappers).
- Projects with >20% MoM star growth but low issue activity.
- Pre-due diligence for Seed/Series A rounds.

### Core Health Metrics:
| Metric | Formula | Healthy Range | Risk Signal |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Star/Fork Ratio** | Stars ÷ Forks | 5x – 10x | >20x (Vanity/Bot risk) |
| **Star/Issue Ratio** | Stars ÷ Issues | 50x – 100x | >200x (Low engagement) |
| **Fork Rate** | Forks ÷ Stars | 9% – 23% | <5% (Low conversion) |
| **Watcher Rate** | Subscribers ÷ Stars | Baseline | Unpolluted signal |

> **Integration Note:** If the Star Health Protocol is active and returns "Weak" signals, the score for Dimension A should be penalized by **1.0 - 2.0 points**, regardless of absolute star count.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What metrics actually matter when evaluating an open source AI project for investment — beyond GitHub stars?**

Stars measure visibility, not investability. The framework weights four higher-signal metrics instead:
- **PR velocity** (commits per week, time-to-merge) — measures active development health
- **Production dependents** — how many real projects import this as a dependency
- **Contributor diversity** — single-maintainer projects fail at scale regardless of star count
- **Revenue quality** — ARR from enterprise contracts outweighs usage-based or donation income

A project with 2,000 stars and 40 production dependents is more investable than one with 40,000 stars and 3 dependents. LLaMA-Factory has 68K stars and scores borderline Pass on this framework.

---

**Q: What are the automatic disqualifiers — red flags that kill a deal regardless of total score?**

Six One-Vote Vetoes trigger an automatic Pass regardless of weighted score:

1. **Core IP not owned by the entity** — contributor IP not properly assigned
2. **License incompatibility** — copyleft obligations that block commercial use
3. **Single-maintainer bus factor with no succession plan**
4. **No path to US market access** — critical for USD-denominated exit
5. **Active litigation or unresolved patent claims** on foundational technology
6. **Fabricated benchmarks** — any evidence of manipulated performance claims

A project scoring 8.2/10 on dimensions still receives a Pass if any veto applies.

---

**Q: How does this framework handle projects where ARR or revenue isn't public?**

V1.2 introduced indirect signal inference for early-stage projects (Seed/Series A):

- **SOC2 Type II certification** → signals enterprise sales motion is underway
- **Billing complexity in public API docs** → indicates commercial tiers exist
- **Senior GTM/sales hires on LinkedIn** → revenue pursuit without disclosed numbers
- **Enterprise case studies on website** → production adoption even without ARR disclosure

"No public revenue data" ≠ "no revenue." The framework explicitly distinguishes these.

---

**Q: How do open source AI projects monetize — and which models are most investable?**

Revenue quality hierarchy (highest to lowest investability):

1. **ARR from enterprise contracts** — predictable, sticky, highest multiple
2. **Usage-based cloud revenue** — scales with adoption
3. **Dual-license commercial tier** — proven OSS model (HashiCorp, Elastic)
4. **Professional services / consulting** — doesn't scale, weak signal
5. **Donations / sponsorships only** — red flag, no commercial validation

Projects like Unsloth (8.10/10) score high despite no disclosed ARR because 150M+ downloads and YC backing signal imminent commercial traction.

---

**Q: What's the difference between a "Watch" verdict and a "Pass"?**

- **Watch (5.5–6.9):** Real signals exist but 1–2 critical elements are missing — usually PMF evidence or GTM capability. Re-evaluate in 6–9 months. These are pipeline entries, not rejections.
- **Pass (<5.5):** Fundamental structural issues — missing moat, no community traction, or a One-Vote Veto applies.

DeerFlow (6.15, Watch ⚠️Corp) is Watch because ByteDance backing structurally limits exit potential — but the technology is real. WFGY (5.80, Watch) is Watch because PMF is unproven, not because the technical thesis is wrong.

---

**Q: How does this compare to standard VC due diligence for SaaS or traditional software?**

Three gaps this framework fills that standard VC frameworks miss:

1. **Community health as a first-class signal** — 25% weight on ecosystem health reflects that open source distribution is the moat, not a feature.
2. **Corp flag discipline** — projects backed by Alibaba, ByteDance, or Ant Group are flagged (⚠️Corp) because corporate ownership structurally constrains exit optionality regardless of technology quality.
3. **Calibrated anchors** — every score is relative to vLLM (8.9/10, $800M valuation) and Hugging Face (8.35/10, $4.5B valuation). Without anchors, scores are opinions.
